# UFOs
UFO data using JavaScript

## Overview:

The purpose of this repository is to create a website that compiles the data of several UFO sightings and makes it easier for the user to search through the data. Several filter criteria have been set up so that the user may enter in a date, city, state, or shape.

## Results:

To filter the UFO sighting results, type in a date, city, state, country, or UFO state. If nothing is entered in the search criteria, all UFO sighting results will show up.

Not all boxes need to be filled out for a search to be performed.

## Summary:

The drawback of this website is that it is case sensitive, but most people would capitalize proper nouns such as city and country names. This may make people think that there are no results for particular city, state, or country when there are.
The summary addresses two additional recommendations for further development (4 pt)
The next step of this webpage would be to not make the serach results case sensitive. For example, it would be more user-friendly if both "TX" and "tx" returned results for the state of Texas. Another recommendation would be to change the fill-in-the-blank search boxes to a dropdown menu. That way, users could not enter in search criteria that does not exist.
